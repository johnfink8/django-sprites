django-sprites is a Django app with two bundled models that handle 
Sprites and their associated SpriteItems.  

    * A Sprite is a combined image, consisting of one or more 
      SpriteItems, each of which is an image intended to be used as an 
      image background for an HTML element.
    
    * Combining these background images into a single image can 
      enormously save on load times.  There is a lot of time loss in 
      sequentially requesting multiple images from the same server, and 
      only 2-4 can be requested simultaneously.  So if you have 20 or 
      30, that could add hundreds or thousands of milliseconds to your 
      overall page load.
    
    * Each SpriteItem contains the info actually relevant to your site 
      design, like the image itself, dimensions (which are calculated),
      HTML attributes like class and id, and these are used by the 
      model methods to generate styling, full CSS lines, and/or an HTML
      tag source with the relevant image behind it and any input HTML 
      inside.

Requirements:

    *  PIL, with libjpeg support
    
    *  Django (obviously)
    
    *  Uuid
    
    *  urllib2
    
Setup:

    *  Add to your settings.py:
        'sprites',
    
    *  Also in settings.py:
        MEDIA_ROOT = 'path/to/your/actual/intended/media/root'
        
        This will be used along with the relative paths in the next 
        config items to determine save locations for images.
        
        
        MEDIA_URL = 'http://myserver.mydomain.com/media'
        
        This is used by Django to generate URLs for ImageFiles, in
        addition to the relative paths below.  Fully-qualified path is
        not actually required, but it's better to make it fully-
        qualified here so that you can use the HTML on any domain, not
        just the same as your Django app.
    
    *  Also in settings.py (optional):
        SPRITE_PATH = '<some relative path to store sprites>'
        SPRITE_ITEM_PATH = '<another relative path>'
        
        These default to 'sprites' and 'sprite_items', respectively.


ToDo:  

    *  Further refinements for storage, including S3 storage and hooks
       to make it user-extendable
    
    *  Finish ToDo list
